## Introduction
TensorCast is a performance simulation and analysis framework for PyTorch programs. It empowers developers and researchers to predict the performance of their neural network models on specific hardware configurations without needing access to the physical machine.

At its core, TensorCast operates as a "virtual machine" or a runtime simulator. Instead of executing computations on a live accelerator, it intercepts a PyTorch program's computational graph and simulates its execution on a user-defined MachineConfig. This configuration specifies the target hardware's characteristics, such as theoretical compute power (TFLOPS), memory bandwidths, cache hierarchies, and interconnect speeds. In order to accurately estimate the optimal performance of the model on the given HW, TensorCast provides a model optimization pipeline including automatic model sharding, quantization and FX-graph optimization converting the source program into an optimal one before conducting the analysis.

By running a model on this "virtual" hardware, TensorCast provides detailed performance insights, including:

- Out-of-the-box support for Huggingface transformer models.

- Support various hardware accelerator devices with simple configurations.

- Operator-level execution time: Estimated using extensible models like analytic roofline model, empirical data, or ML-based predictors.

- Memory footprint: Tracks total and peak memory allocation.

- Computational characteristics: Analyzes FLOPs (Floating Point Operations) and memory access volume for each operator.

- Advanced Scheduling Simulation: Models complex execution patterns like concurrent computations across multiple streams.

The final output includes both comprehensive summary tables and detailed Chrome Trace files, allowing for deep visualization and identification of performance bottlenecks.

## Supported Accelerators
We support most of the AI accelerator devices with simple configurations. We have built-in support for Ascend ATLAS-family accelerators in `device.py` and also provide more device examples under `device_profile_examples` that can be copied into `device_profiles` folder for experiments. Note that these are examples for reference only - we do not guarantee their correctness.

### Custom device types
You may also define your own device types in a Python file and drop it under `device_profiles` folder. TensorCast will load them automatically. Refer to `device.py` for examples how to define a new device.

## How to use
### Supported python versions
3.10+

> [!Warning]
> If you are using Windows, note that PyTorch 2.10 may not run properly on your system. For a solution, please refer to [this issue](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/166628). If you have not yet installed PyTorch, for optimal compatibility, we strongly recommend using version 2.8 or earlier to ensure the program functions correctly.

### Install required packages
```bash
git clone https://gitcode.com/Ascend/msmodeling.git -b develop
cd msmodeling
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run text generation with given query length
We provide a `text_generate.py` command line interface to simulate the text generation. The script supports text generation with a batch of queries with the same input length and optionally same context length. The table summary of op performance breakdown is provided by default. An option is also provided to dump the chrome trace.

Its general usage is shown below:
```text
usage: text_generate.py [-h]

Run `python -m cli.inference.text_generate --help` for details.


### Run video generation inference for diffusion models
We provide a `video_generate.py` command line interface to simulate the forward pass and performance of diffusion transformer models. The script supports simulating the inference process of video generation models (e.g., Stable Video Diffusion-like architectures) with configurable input dimensions, sampling steps, and parallelism settings. A detailed table summary of operator performance breakdown is provided by default. An option is also provided to dump the performance timeline as a Chrome Trace file.

Its general usage is shown below:
```text
usage: video_generate.py [-h]
                         [--device {TEST_DEVICE,ATLAS_800_A2_376T_64G,ATLAS_800_A2_313T_64G,ATLAS_800_A2_280T_64G,ATLAS_800_A2_280T_64G_PCIE,ATLAS_800_A2_280T_32G_PCIE,ATLAS_800_A3_752T_128G_DIE,ATLAS_800_A3_560T_128G_DIE}]

#### External Shared Experts & Redundant Experts Implementation
The following outlines the implementation logic for External Shared Experts and Redundant Experts.

1. Redundant Experts Only:
Each device will host an additional redundant expert.

2. External Shared Experts Only:
Devices are allocated between external shared experts and routing experts at a ratio of 1:`top_k`. Redundant experts are used to pad routing experts if needed.
For example, if `world_size` is 64, `top_k` is 8, and number of routing experts is 256, 8 devices are assigned to host external shared experts.
The remaining 56 devices are used to distribute 256 routing experts. 32 devices host 5 routing experts each. 24 devices host 4 routing experts and 1 redundant expert.

3. Both External Shared Experts & Redundant Experts Enabled: 
The allocation logic is identical to the "External Shared Experts Only" mode, with one addition: If no redundant experts are needed to pad routing experts (i.e., routing experts are evenly distributed across devices), each device hosting routing experts will host an additional redundant expert.

#### Run Prefill
To run a prefill of Qwen3-32B with two requests with 3500-token input length each on A2. You can run the following command:
```bash
python -m cli.inference.text_generate Qwen/Qwen3-32B --num-queries 2 --query-length 3500 --device TEST_DEVICE
```
You can also quantize the linear with various quantization schemes, such as W8A8 dynamic quantization and with 4500-token context as the prefix:
```bash
python -m cli.inference.text_generate Qwen/Qwen3-32B --num-queries 2 --query-length 3500 --context-length 4500 --device TEST_DEVICE --quantize-linear-action W8A8_DYNAMIC
```

#### Run Decode
Running decode is similar by tweaking the input length and context length. Usually, the input length is 1.
```bash
python -m cli.inference.text_generate Qwen/Qwen3-32B --num-queries 10 --query-length 1 --context-length 4500 --device TEST_DEVICE --quantize-linear-action W8A8_STATIC
```
